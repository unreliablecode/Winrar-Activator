## Usage

Before running this utility, please ensure you have the necessary permissions to write to the WinRAR installation directory. Use this utility responsibly and only on systems you own or have explicit permission to modify.

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/unreliablecode/Winrar-Activator.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd WinRAR-Key-Generator
    ```

3. Compile and run the program using the programming language of your choice (C#, Bash, C, C++, F#, Java, Python, or Visual Basic). Below are examples of how to run the program in different languages:

    - **C#**:

        ```bash
        csc Program.cs
        Program.exe
        ```

    - **Bash**:

        ```bash
        bash program.sh
        ```

    - **C**:

        ```bash
        gcc program.c -o program
        ./program
        ```

    - **C++**:

        ```bash
        g++ program.cpp -o program
        ./program
        ```

    - **F#**:

        ```bash
        dotnet fsi program.fsx
        ```

    - **Java**:

        ```bash
        javac Program.java
        java Program
        ```

    - **Python**:

        ```bash
        python program.py
        ```

    - **Visual Basic**:

        ```bash
        vbc Program.vb
        Program.exe
        ```

4. Follow the on-screen instructions. You will be asked to confirm the operation by entering 'Y' or 'N'.

5. If you choose to proceed ('Y'), the program will attempt to locate the WinRAR installation directory and create a `rarreg.key` file with the provided license information. The generated key file will be saved in the WinRAR installation directory.

6. Once the process is complete, you will receive a confirmation message indicating the location of the `rarreg.key` file.
